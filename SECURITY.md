# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Every version is scanned for vulnerabilities. However, this script does not have any 3rd party dependancies, and should not impose a security risk. You can use this policy and the security scan data to show the ISSE or security manager if required.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Solaris 11 STIG Checker project, please submit an issue. I will acknowledge reply to the issue within 24 hours and will provide a more detailed response within 48 hours, including an expected resolution date.

Please include the following information in your issue:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Any additional information that may be helpful in identifying and resolving the issue

Once the vulnerability is verified, I will work to identify and implement a fix as quickly as possible. I may also request additional information from you to assist in the resolution process.

I take all security vulnerabilities seriously (as long as they are applicable) and will keep you informed throughout the process. If the vulnerability is accepted, I will provide credit for the discovery in our release notes. If the vulnerability is declined, I will provide a detailed explanation of why it was not accepted. That being said...we all have day jobs.
